Master Project Image explorer (MPE) is an open frameworks application developed for conducting user study and evaluation of test subjects (photographers). 
Interface #1
User Selection
The images are laid out in a grid and can be selected by clicking on it.
A larger image is displayed to the right for enhanced clarity.

Interface #2 
User Evaluation
Once the user has selected a sufficient number roof images that match their aesthetics (30-50) the user is introduced to the second interface which displays all the selected images and a parallel coordinate system to manipulate it. The parallel coordinates displays the image EXIF data on 4 axis : focal length, shutter speed, ISO, aperture. Generally trends can be visually evaluated. The parallel coordinates can be scrubbed to select images of a particular technical aesthetic. Hovering over the image highlights the EXIF information on the parallel coordinates.
